Outline:

* My struggle with burnout over the past year
* Trying to solve the problem, work harder, work smarter, neither worked.
  * Work harder - waking up at 5AM again
  * Work smarter - Tried a ton of productivity systems
* Realizing the problem was my anxiety, and that my anxiety comes from my own expectations
* Realizing how productivity systems missed the point, and how they led me to working harder or smarter, not reducing my anxiety
  * I already know what work I could be doing with my time! The problem wasn't that I didn't know _what_ to work on, it's that I didn't know _how_ to get myself to do it. Nothing but last-minute panic was working.
* New solution:
  * Main goal during the day is to manage my anxiety, which shows itself in two ways:
    * 1. Falling behind expectations
      * When I'm feeling like I'm not going to be able to complete everything I need to do, it creates serious anxiety for me. 
        * First step was just recognizing that, and realizing how important it was not to fight through that, but to stop, take a second to accept that it's how I'm feeling, explore the sensation in my body, and consciously breathe through it and accept it before returning to work. Regulating my emotions, especially my anxiety, helps it not grow to the point that I can't handle it.
        * I also realized that I could change some of my habits to remove some of my triggers from my daily life that generate the anxiety:
          * No to-do list. I do keep a list for stray thoughts while I'm working and for ideas that come to me via my subconscious, but they don't get put into a list of work. Important things are self-evident to work on!
          * In a similar vein, no daily planning. All of that planning is unrealistic anyway, after over a year it's clear that I'll never be able to get done everything I want. It's time for me to let go of that wish. 
          * Single-tasking. Phone goes away during the work day, not even in the same room. 
            * I'm fortunate to be able to do this, won't always be able to, but I'm going to seriously consider two phone lines in the future, one only known to family for emergencies.
          * Healthier work/break cadence. I tried a lot of different methods, and I'm still exploring here, but I'm not allowed to work for longer than 90 minutes straight without a break, and breaks should give my conscious mind time to turn off, which means no screens or anything that involves a cognitive load. Ideally, something like taking a walk works best. 
            * Basically, something that allows active meditation/mindfullness is ideal.
            * Alternatively, I also find that getting my heart rate going even for five minutes is great for priming myself.
      * 2. Anxiety of not working
        * Similar but different, my first trigger is about falling behind during the day, which is about not working fast enough. This trigger is about not working at all, either taking a day off, taking breaks during the day (this hits both!), and stopping my work at night, when there's always more to do.
    * Lastly, focusing on getting more sleep, more physical exercise (treating the body as an extension of the mind), and being conscious about choosing after-work activities that restore me.
      * Less TV, more hobbies
      * Need to do meditation after finishing work to allow myself to let go of the anxiety of not working.
