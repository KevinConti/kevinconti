## What I'm doing next:

Part of me really wants to write. I don't know if it's just temporary, a decompression, from the constant product work. But I'm torn on this subject.

On one hand, writing is something I enjoy. It's a guaranteed way to gain initial traction on a product. It's a great way to make friends in the industry, and help grow both your personal and business brands. It would be nice to play a game where the only risk is product risk ("can I produce quality content consistently?") instead of market risk ("will people be interested in buying this?").

On the other hand, I've never been able to write consistently. I want to write what I want to write about (like this post), regardless of who reads it. I don't want to build an audience, I want to prove that a bootstrapped founder can be successful based on the quality of the product alone.

### As far as CoderNotes, I want to let it grow organically.

It wouldn't be right to call it life-support. Yes, I don't plan on adding many new features, if any at all, but that's because CoderNotes is a great piece of software as is. Any other features are simply nice-to-haves.

I never found any successful short-term channels with CoderNotes. I had hoped that the communities I was a part of, becoming more active on twitter, and paid advertising would be enough to consistently drive converting traffic to CoderNotes.

As you can see, the results I saw were almost the opposite in effect. While twitter brought in some curious people, the conversion rate was horrible.

IndieHackers was the second best, which speaks to the fact that it is such an amazing community. Even though I'm sure many of these people were only here out of curiosity, it still remained a well-converting group. A lot of IHers are developers by trade, which I think helped a lot. However, Indie Hackers isn't nearly enough traffic to keep the site alive on its own, due to the extremely low price point of $50/year or $5/month. The few subscriptions I'll end up getting through here probably won't cover infrastructure costs.

Oh, and google ads ("google / cpc" in the picture above) had an abysmal 0.00% conversion rate. Ouch.

### While there's no short-term channels for CoderNotes, there are two very strong positives in the picture above.

These two channels in the picture above are the reason I'm not calling this next phase of CoderNotes "life support". It's my all-in bet on why CoderNotes still has a chance at success, from a longer-term perspective. It's either this or bust, it seems:

Take a look at #7. What does it mean for my app to be referring users to my marketing page? Seems weird, right?

Well, not really. The only link from the app that goes back to the site is this one here:

It's a small link that shows up at the top of the app if you don't have an account. The high conversion rate means that this link **works**.

And how would someone find this link without having gone through the marketing page first? Google.

## What I'm doing long-term

For CoderNotes, the long-term strategy is to let it grow organically via Google. As users add public notes to the platform, they get indexed by Google. This, in turn, leads to more people finding CoderNotes in their search results. When developers find a new site like this that solved their problem, they are curious and want to sign up themselves. That's why that link has converted so well!

I've been reading Good Strategy, Bad Strategy recently, and they discuss that Good Strategy is having a clear understanding of the reality of a situation, and making a decision while being conscious of the trade-offs.

For right now, Good Strategy for CoderNotes is to go with the flow of the river, even if it's slower than I'd like. Let google continue to rank CoderNotes higher and higher, leading to more and more daily traffic. Some of those people will sign up, and eventually we may even find that some people are interested in a team subscription. If and when that time comes, it will make sense to re-invest in CoderNotes.

In the meantime, it's time to step off the treadmill, and put my time into something else. It's time to find a different lever to pull, one where short-to-medium term focus will be rewarded.

### Where Iâ€™m going personally:
