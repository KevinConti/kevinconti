By far, the biggest challenge new founders face isn't in building a product or service - it's in learning marketing.

I've seen it constantly, both in my own businesses as well as those I've worked with at [Software Ideas](https://www.softwareideas.io/?utm_campaign=content-marketing&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=kevinconti.com).

So I decided to turn everything I've learned into a set of marketing guides, with the goal of making the **absolute best guides on the market**.

And I wanted them to be free.

They are coming out slowly, but I'll keep a list here as they are released:

\#1: [Community Marketing](https://www.softwareideas.io/blog/community-marketing?utm_campaign=content-marketing&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=kevinconti.com "Community Marketing")

Community Marketing is about engaging with communities to help sell your product. It's probably the most popular marketing channel for bootstrappers, and it's also the one that 90% of people get **wrong**.

There's a reason I started with this one first, so please check it out if you are struggling to acquire customers from social media, forums, or other communities!
