title = "Why I'm Ending Software Ideas"

+++
When I announced the completion of Software Ideas to our readers, I focused mostly on the business reasons for why it made sense to stop. I wanted to keep the email to the point, even though there was so much I wanted to say to cap off these past two years.

Well, here is where I'm writing everything down.

Software Ideas has been an incredible project for me. It's led to some really cool projects and businesses from readers, and it gave me an excuse to take a break from full-time development and work on a business, build my own knowledge of marketing, and experience hiring and managing multiple employees (contractors, technically) for the first time since I briefly ran a cleaning business in college.
