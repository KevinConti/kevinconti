## What went well:

### 1. The initial pivot

I initially made CoderNotes for a different problem than the general one it ended up solving. At first, CoderNotes was a solution for junior developers taking coding courses. It was designed to be a note-taking system that improved retention. It would have features like:

* Spaced repetition
* Public and private flashcards
* Comments on flashcards

When I reached out to developers to share the idea (my first mistake, as we'll see later), I found that while only some junior developers related to that pain, there was a specific value prop that everyone could get behind:

!["You know you've solved the problem before, but can't remember how](/forestry/problem.png "The pivot's value prop")

When I interviewed people about this pain, I got a lot of affirmative responses. I took this as validation and ran with it, immediately lowering my head into the ground to start working.

Eventually, I created CoderNotes.
