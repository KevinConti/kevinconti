The experience of making CoderNotes.io felt a lot like playing a sport after reading a book on it. You quickly realize that even though you know the theory, putting it in practice is a whole other beast.

That said, there are three things I feel I did correctly that I'll be sure to do again in the future. In part 2, I'll write about all the things I feel I did wrong (far more than three!), and how I'm tackling them next time.

## Things that worked... I think.

### 1. The initial pivot

I initially made CoderNotes for a different problem. At first, it was a solution for junior developers taking coding courses. It was designed to be a note-taking system that improved retention. I imagined it to have features like:

* Spaced repetition
* Public and private flashcards
* Ability to share "decks" (sets of flashcards)

When I reached out to developers to share the idea, I found that while only some junior developers related to that pain, there was a specific value prop that everyone could get behind:

!["You know you've solved the problem before, but can't remember how](/forestry/problem.png "The pivot's value prop")

When I interviewed people about this pain, I got a lot of affirmative responses. I took this as validation and ran with it, immediately lowering my head into the ground to start working.

Eventually, I created CoderNotes.
