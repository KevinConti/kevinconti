## What's this about?

The SoftwareIdeas.io daily blog is home to my daily stand-up of the project. Each day, I talk about what's been happening, what's on my mind, and how I plan to move the business forward.

## Why should I care?

If you're interested in seeing the unfiltered behind-the-scenes of how SoftwareIdeas.io came about, you'll be able to find it here. It starts from the day I joined a group where everyone in the group was planning on launching a new product within the month.

I wanted to join, even though the month before (June 2020) I had acquired pre-sales for my product, at the time just called the "Downstream SaaS Newsletter". I hadn't launched it publicly yet, so it was a good fit. In these daily updates, you'll see the product go from $0 MRR and skyrocket to over $1,500 by the end of the first month. The specifics of how I did it are all included in the updates.

## Hey, you're missing some posts...

Sorry about that. I'm working on getting them moved over. Expect this in the next couple days.

#### Now, onto the post!

**$1,806 MRR, $5,866 in sales**

I worked a lot this weekend on the Membership site, and it's starting to come along nicely. I was able to get a Phoenix application that is using a new authorization framework that makes things stupid easy (and is secure by default).

It only took a day to implement user registration, login, forgot password emails, and "keep me signed in" options!

So far I'm thinking that I made the right decision to hand-roll the site myself instead of using Memberstack, even though typically I'd say that you shouldn't write your own code just to save money in a business. The reason it's different for me is because Memberstack and similar have two big flaws:

1. They want to be the source of truth for your members, including payments. That means I would have either had to figure how to integrate their payments on my marketing page (which is auto-generated by landen.co and may have been impossible), or I would have had to scrap my marketing page and build one from scratch, which seemed like making work to save work.
2. They can only dynamically hide content, meaning that if for some reason Memberstack fails to load on your site, non-authenticated visitors can see all of your content, even things that should be hidden.

With Phoenix, I can keep Stripe as my single source of truth (great since I depend on it for my landing page and things like Baremetrics), plus I can more reliably hide content, since the user's browser will never even see the hidden content unless they are already authenticated. Phoenix makes this really easy.

Even though I probably worked 8-10 hours, I specifically didn't do any work in customer support or marketing, and I think it did a lot of good for me recharging my batteries.

Working only on development actually felt like a fun way to spend the weekend, so I'm feeling relatively recharged. I think I'll be forcing myself to do this on the weekends more often.

Of course, it means that today I have a backlog of things to do. Here are my goals:

-   Switch my daily updates to my blog (if you're reading this, it's already done!)
-   Let my friends on MegaMaker know
-   Edit Issue #8
-   Write Idea #1 for Issue #9
-   (Stretch) Add Stripe integration into the membership site, to only allow people to register if they have an active subscription

Like I've mentioned before, Monday is my big day for getting ahead, but that being said even this is probably beyond my reach. It's 7:00 AM now and I need to edit by 8:30. Normally that wouldn't be too hard, but I've been thinking more about the free newsletter.

The free newsletter has only been generating 25-35% opens. Currently, the free newsletter is the exact same as the paid newsletter, but it hides some sections. Basically, it includes the market research, but not the software idea.

I've been thinking about how I could make it better. I'm still debating this and I'm out of time, so I think Issue #8's preview newsletter will have to be the same format as I've had before. I'll see what I can come up with for Issue #9.

Alright, last thought: I've only had 3 out of 10 resubscribe from the original pre-sale. Not great numbers, unfortunately. If we apply that to my regular customers, we would have almost 25% monthly churn, which is not sustainable. The goal of August is to double the value of a subscription, which hopefully will reduce churn as a side-effect. But September's goal will be to make the product less churn-worthy. There are a couple ways of doing that, but I'll wait to talk about them when we get there.

Long post today, thanks for reading!

#### August 4th

**$1,900 MRR, $6,151 in sales**

##### Recap

Woot, \$1900 MRR! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

I have an extremely aggresive revenue goal of getting to \$3,000 by the end of August, but it's looking possible right now. Really cool.

Yesterday, I was able to accomplish all of the goals I had set out for myself, which is great. The membership site now checks your membership status when you try to create an account! Here's what's left:

-   Check membership status when signing in (a repeat of the logic I already wrote, just in another place)
-   Add the Stripe Customer Portal to allow people to cancel subscriptions / create subscriptions
-   Make the UI all pretty

I'm feeling reasonably confident that I can get this done by my self-imposed deadline by the 17th. The scariest part was the authentication, and that's now taken care of.

##### Goals

Today's goals are:

1. Write idea #2 for Issue #9
2. (Stretch) Do signing-in logic
3. Follow up with non-renewal people from the pre-sales, try to gain some insight into why they didn't renew.

Not a lot, but I'm limited on my time on Tuesdays

##### Planning

I modified my goals yesterday [on twitter](https://twitter.com/Kev_Conti/status/1290384377990598660).

My big-picture goal for the month of August is to **double the value of a softwareideas.io subscription for people actively searching for their next business idea**.

The KPI I'm using to track this is the ratio of email signups to paid users. I'll be tracking this every day along with my MRR and sales numbers. Yesterday, it was 16.46. Today, it's 14.74. My goal is 8.23.

Making progress!

#### August 6th

**$2,035 MRR, $6,151 in sales, 14.14 Subscriber : Paid ratio**

![](/forestry/2000-mrr.JPG)

Hit \$2k MRR today. It's such a crazy feeling, because today marks one whole month since the product publically launched. I'm posting a milestone on IndieHackers today to share, but I won't go into much here. In fact, here I want to talk about the other side of the coin.

But first, let's recap goals:

##### Recap

Yesterday, I had a great call with Dru Riley of Trends. We talked about the newsletter business, shared some private metrics, and overall it was a great chat. We have another one planned for next week. It's great to be able to talk to someone in a similar business as me.

##### Goals

My goals for today are as follows:

-   Post the IH milestone, share it around some communities
-   Finish Idea #3 and edit #1 and #2
-   (Stretch) start writing the free newsletter

##### KPI

My main goal for this month is to get my Subscriber : Paid Customer ration down from it's peak of 16.46 to 8.23. Today it's sitting pretty at 14.14. That's thanks to two bigger-than-average sales days. There are a lot of ways to improve this ratio, and two that I'm working on behind the scenes are:

1. Improve the free "preview" newsletter to increase conversions from my existing email list
2. Improve the drip campaign to give more value, hopefully increasing conversions
3. Improve my analytics so I can identify which channels are working and which ones aren't

All of these will help with the ratio, but the reason I choose the ratio as the KPI from the beginning was so that I could double the value of a softwareideas.io subscription. The main effort I'm making here is by creating the membership site, the first piece of members-only bonus content (I need a better name for this), and opening up my first software partnerships.

All of that is coming along, but slowly. I have just eight more working days until that goal, and I hope I can deliver on-time. Thankfully, the first piece of bonus content is mostly done, and it shouldn't take too much time. The membership site is almost done from a technical perspective (authentication and content-filtering), after that is just about making it look good and setting up the newsletter archive.

##### Success

\$2,000 MRR in 30 days. It's great, but there's a serious downside. I hate the feeling of demotivating some of my friends.

I've noticed that some really hard-working friends who probably deserve to be more successful than me are feeling a little demotivated because of my own situation. It sucks that it's happening because I want to be a message of "You can do it too, faster than me probably." I don't want to be the reason people get demotivated and give up.

I don't know. I don't have coherent thoughts around this. I'm just worried that if the small amount of success I've seen so far is causing resentment, then if I keep growing at the rate I'm growing at, I'll end up losing people I consider friends. I hope that doesn't happen.

#### August 7th

**$2,186 MRR, $7,006 in sales, 13.84 Subscriber : Paid ratio**

Yesterday I posted the \$2,000 MRR milestone to IndieHackers. That usually leads to a ton of new signups for the free newsletter, but thankfully the conversion rate was high enough that the subsriber : paid ratio still went down. Still heading down towards 8.23!

##### Goals

My goals for today are:

-   Edit Issue #9
-   Write Issue #9 preview using new format
-   (Stretch) Work on membership site to store and use membership status on login
-   Meeting with analytics expert on how I could be better tracking my analytics

I'm pretty excited about that meeting, and I'm hoping I'll have some free time today to work on the memberhsip site. It's still up in the air though.

I'm noticing that there's a number of little things that are slipping through the cracks. I've definitely had to choose where to prioritize my time. It's too early to bring someone on, but I wish I had the ability to hire an administrative assistant or some other VA that could catch these little things. Hopefully in the near future!
