## Edit: Fate is a funny thing

I wrote what you see below around the first of June. On the seventh, ProductHunt relaunched my product, [bumping it up to number one](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/codernotes/1-product-of-the-day-on-producthunt--M9DjlN9JekWM8g_bZF-) before settling into the #2 product of the day. 

It's quite ironic, and super lucky. It's given me a bit of opportunity to connect to more customers than I thought I would be able to, and given me some hope to explore if it's possible to find product/solution fit for CoderNotes. I'm leaving what I wrote below untouched, because I think it's important to show the journey as raw as possible. There are highs and lows. I wrote this in a bit of a tentative low, and right now I'm writing in a bit of a tentative high. There's so much uncertainty at this point in CoderNotes.io's life, and it makes it hard to write clearly. 

Anyway, back to the program.

## CoderNotes has finally launched.

I'm happy that it's done. This was my first product, my stairstep product in the SaaS category. CoderNotes is a really high-quality product (in my not-so-humble opinion), and I'm extremely proud of it.

From a product perspective, it's everything I wanted in a note-taking software. I use it daily both in my personal life and for my work. It's a great feeling to have "scratched my own itch".

But, from an entrepreneurial perspective, I've wanted to write this retrospective on the project. I don't believe CoderNotes will reach the goals I had for the product during the initial vision.

It's not that it's failing, per-se. I think it's a great product that will slowly grow in revenue over time.

It's also too soon to talk about this. Hence the name "Pre-Retrospective". I'm guessing that the June 1st launch will be mediocre. Maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who gets skyrocked to #1 on Product Hunt, but one lesson I've learned from this project is to not rely on luck as a primary factor of success.

So, CoderNotes won't be a home-run, but it isn't a strike-out.

**It feels more like a foul ball.**

I'm writing this article to organize my thoughts around what went well and what went wrong over the past five months. I also want to organize my takeaways from CoderNotes, and come to some conclusions around what the long-term plan for CoderNotes will be, what the lessons learned are, and what the next project I'm tackling is, if any for now.

This post is so big, that I've broken it down into three parts: You can find the links below
