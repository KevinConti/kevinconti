## What didn't go well:

### No good short-term channels:

When starting CoderNotes, I thought that

## What I learned:

Look at a business as the sum of three parts:

1. The market (who is interested in this?)
2. The channels (How can I reach the market?)
3. The product (What am I offering via the channel?)

You'll notice that I put the product last. This might seem backwards, but I think it's the right spot for it. It's a failure of the English language to say "I'm building a product." It skips over the two equally important parts, and gives a misleading image of what it means to create a SaaS business.

It would be more accurate to say, _"I'm building authority in \[channels\] to serve \[market\], and will be offering \[product\] for those it can help."_
