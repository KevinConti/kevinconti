I've been reading Fooled by Randomness recently, and it's convinced me that it's better to talk in terms of falsifiable hypotheses, as opposed to unverifiable truisms. As such, I want to dedicate a page to only advice on what NOT to do.

Let me spend a paragraph convincing you:

## On Advice

The book Fooled by Randomness asserts this point much better than I am going to, but I'll give a more simple example than Taleb (the author) does.

Imagine I were to give you the piece of advice, "Stop eating vegetables, they give you cancer. I can show you 1,000 people who ate vegetables and got cancer, and 1,000 people who only ate meat and didn't get cancer." Would you take my advice?

Hopefully not. You know that, in the world, there are many millions of people. 1,000 is a large number, but it is still too small to be of statistical significance. 

To avoid survivorship bias, we also need to look at the people who ate meat and did get cancer, as well as the people who ate veggies and didn't. Once you did that, you'd probably conclude that I'm out of my mind and never talk to me again.

Even if there was statistical significance, what's to say these two things aren't just correlated? There are hundreds of reasons why these could be true:

* People who eat only meat are unique individuals, and a health-focused, thus making cancer less-likely
* People who only eat meat tend to live in certain areas that have fewer cases of cancer
* People who eat veggies eat more carbs, and an overload of sugar is the problem, not veggies

And so on and so fourth.

There's a similar joke along the same vein. Throughout history, as the number of pirates has gone down, global warming has increased. The conclusion: Pirates prevent global warming!

Obviously, this isn't true. But think of how many other examples besides pirates we could find. It's infinitely more difficult to confirm a causal hypothesis than to reject one.

For example, it only takes one black swan to reject the hypothesis that "All swans are white". But even after seeing 1,000,000,000 white swans, we still can't confirm that same hypothesis.

#### Now, let's apply this to business.

If there are 1,000 biographies on ultra-successful startup founders, and they all say that hard work, skill, and luck are what they used to create their unicorn, what should we think?

Like above, we need to first investigate the true sample size. How many people have tried to start companies with hard work, skill, and luck? 100,000? 1,000,000? Way, way more?

If we look and learn from all of the failed restaurants, gyms, factories, etc, we'll find plenty of failures who had hard work, skill, and luck who still failed.

So what does this mean? It means that hard work, skill, and luck are not sufficient to start a successful company. It means that we have fallen for surviorship bias.

### In this article, we'll avoid survivorship bias.

Instead of offering advice on what you should do, I'm going to give you advice on what failed for me. These are mistakes I have made that I am reasonably certain were missteps, which you can easily apply to your own founder journey.

Since this advice captures what NOT to do, we free ourselves from the above problems. Instead we're faced with a new one: Advice on what not to do doesn't feel as satisfying.

In response to that, I'll remind you that advice on what TO do is less useful, less actionable, and less reliable, even though it feels better. And the founder's journey is about doing what leads to results instead of good feelings. 

You in?

Cool.
