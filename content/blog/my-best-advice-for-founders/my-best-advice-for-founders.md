I've been reading Fooled by Randomness recently, and it's convinced me that it's better to talk in terms of falsifiable hypotheses, as opposed to unverifiable truisms. As such, I want to dedicate a page to only advice on what NOT to do. 

Let me spend a paragraph convincing you:

## On Advice

The book Fooled by Randomness asserts this point much better than I am going to, but I'll give a more simple example than Taleb (the author) does.

Imagine I were to give you the piece of advice, "Stop eating vegetables, they give you cancer. I can show you 1,000 people who ate vegetables and got cancer, and 1,000 people who only ate meat and didn't get cancer." Would you take my advice?

Hopefully not. You know that, in the world, there are so many millions of people. 1,000 is a large number, but it is still too small to be of statistical significance. Even if it was, what's to say these two things aren't just correlated? There are hundreds of reasons why these could be true:

* People who eat only meat are unique individuals, and a health-focused, thus making cancer less-likely
* People who only eat meat tend to live in certain areas that have fewer cases of cancer
* People who eat veggies eat more carbs, and an overload of sugar is the problem, not veggies

And so on and so fourth. 

So, in this example we understand that the number of people who show a trait (1,000 cancer-free meat eaters) is not important unless we know the total sample size (billions of people in the world). Also, we know that just because two things are correlated, it takes FAR more effort to prove any sort of causal link.

Now, let's apply this to business.

If there are 1,000 biographies on ultra-successful startup founders, and they all say that hard work, skill, and luck are what they used to create their unicorn, what should we think?

Like above, we need to first investigate the true sample size. How many people have tried to start companies with hard work, skill, and luck? 100,000? 1,000,000? Way, way more? 

If we look and learn from all of the failed restaurants, gyms, factories, etc, we'll find plenty of failures who had hard work, skill, and luck who still failed.

These are mistakes I have made that I am reasonably certain were missteps, which you can easily apply to your own founder journey.
