## ![](/forestry/problem.jpg)CoderNotes has finally launched.

I'm happy that it's done. This was my first product, my stairstep product in the SaaS category. CoderNotes is a really high-quality product (in my not-so-humble opinion), and I'm extremely proud of it.

From a product perspective, it's everything I wanted in a note-taking software. I use it daily both in my personal life and for my work. It's a great feeling to have "scratched my own itch".

But, from an entrepreneurial perspective, I've wanted to write this retrospective on the project. I don't believe CoderNotes will reach the goals I had for the product during the initial vision.

It's not that it's failing, per-se. I think it's a great product that will slowly grow in revenue over time.

It's also too soon to talk about this. Hence the name "Pre-Retrospective". I'm guessing that the June 1st launch will be mediocre. Maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who gets skyrocked to #1 on Product Hunt, but one lesson I've learned from this project is to not rely on luck as a primary factor of success.

So, CoderNotes won't be a home-run, but it isn't a strike-out.

**It feels more like a foul ball.**

I'm writing this article to organize my thoughts around what went well and what went wrong over the past five months. I also want to organize my takeaways from CoderNotes, and come to some conclusions around what the long-term plan for CoderNotes will be, what the lessons learned are, and what the next project I'm tackling is, if any for now.

## What went well:

### 1. The initial pivot

![](/forestry/the-problem.jpg)

I initially made CoderNotes for a different problem than the general one it ended up solving. At first, CoderNotes was a solution for junior developers taking coding courses. It was designed to be a note-taking system that improved retention. It would have features like:

-   Spaced repetition
-   Public and private flashcards
-   Comments on flashcards

When I reached out to developers to share the idea (my first mistake, as we'll see later), I found that while only some junior developers related to that pain, there was a specific value prop that everyone could get behind:

!["You know you've solved the problem before, but can't remember how](/forestry/problem.png "The pivot's value prop")

When I interviewed people about this pain, I got a lot of affirmative responses. I took this as validation and ran with it, immediately lowering my head into the ground to start working.

Eventually, I created CoderNotes.

## What didn't go well:

### No good short-term channels:

When starting CoderNotes, I thought that

## What I learned:

Look at a business as the sum of three parts:

1. The market (who is interested in this?)
2. The channels (How can I reach the market?)
3. The product (What am I offering via the channel?)

You'll notice that I put the product last. This might seem backwards, but I think it's the right spot for it. It's a failure of the English language to say "I'm building a product." It skips over the two equally important parts, and gives a misleading image of what it means to create a SaaS business.

It would be more accurate to say, _"I'm building authority in \[channels\] to serve \[market\], and will be offering \[product\] for those it can help."_

## What I'm doing next:

Part of me really wants to write. I don't know if it's just temporary, a decompression, from the constant product work. But I'm torn on this subject.

On one hand, writing is something I enjoy. It's a guaranteed way to gain initial traction on a product. It's a great way to make friends in the industry, and help grow both your personal and business brands. It would be nice to play a game where the only risk is product risk ("can I produce quality content consistently?") instead of market risk ("will people be interested in buying this?").

On the other hand, I've never been able to write consistently. I want to write what I want to write about (like this post), regardless of who reads it. I don't want to build an audience, I want to prove that a bootstrapped founder can be successful based on the quality of the product alone.

### As far as CoderNotes, I want to let it grow organically.

It wouldn't be right to call it life-support. Yes, I don't plan on adding many new features, if any at all, but that's because CoderNotes is a great piece of software as is. Any other features are simply nice-to-haves.

I never found any successful short-term channels with CoderNotes. I had hoped that the communities I was a part of, becoming more active on twitter, and paid advertising would be enough to consistently drive converting traffic to CoderNotes.

![](/forestry/conversion-by-source.jpg)

As you can see, the results I saw were almost the opposite in effect. While twitter brought in some curious people, the conversion rate was horrible.

IndieHackers was the second best, which speaks to the fact that it is such an amazing community. Even though I'm sure many of these people were only here out of curiosity, it still remained a well-converting group. A lot of IHers are developers by trade, which I think helped a lot. However, Indie Hackers isn't nearly enough traffic to keep the site alive on its own, due to the extremely low price point of $50/year or $5/month. The few subscriptions I'll end up getting through here probably won't cover infrastructure costs.

Oh, and google ads ("google / cpc" in the picture above) had an abysmal 0.00% conversion rate. Ouch.

### While there's no short-term channels for CoderNotes, there are two very strong positives in the picture above.

These two channels in the picture above are the reason I'm not calling this next phase of CoderNotes "life support". It's my all-in bet on why CoderNotes still has a chance at success, from a longer-term perspective. It's either this or bust, it seems:

Take a look at #7. What does it mean for my app to be referring users to my marketing page? Seems weird, right?

Well, not really. The only link from the app that goes back to the site is this one here:

![](/forestry/learn-more.jpg)

It's a small link that shows up at the top of the app if you don't have an account. The high conversion rate means that this link **works**.

And how would someone find this link without having gone through the marketing page first? Google.

## What I'm doing long-term

![](/forestry/long-term-hope.jpg)

For CoderNotes, the long-term strategy is to let it grow organically via Google. As users add public notes to the platform, they get indexed by Google. This, in turn, leads to more people finding CoderNotes in their search results. When developers find a new site like this that solved their problem, they are curious and want to sign up themselves. That's why that link has converted so well!

I've been reading Good Strategy, Bad Strategy recently, and they discuss that Good Strategy is having a clear understanding of the reality of a situation, and making a decision while being conscious of the trade-offs.

For right now, Good Strategy for CoderNotes is to go with the flow of the river, even if it's slower than I'd like. Let google continue to rank CoderNotes higher and higher, leading to more and more daily traffic. Some of those people will sign up, and eventually we may even find that some people are interested in a team subscription. If and when that time comes, it will make sense to re-invest in CoderNotes.

In the meantime, it's time to step off the treadmill, and put my time into something else. It's time to find a different lever to pull, one where short-to-medium term focus will be rewarded.

### Where Iâ€™m going personally:
